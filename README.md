## About

[Smart Brain]() is a Face identification project created using React.<br /> 

This is the backend part of the project which is deployed on Heroku.

It's loaded with many additional features such as a "secure login system" by encrypting the password into a hash format, remembering the entries count of the users (for images submitted), and displaying back the user details to the front-end.

Here's the link of [front-end repository](https://github.com/KonstantynRomanowski/FaceApp-FrontEnd-).
